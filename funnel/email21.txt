Subject: 21. Focused, not confused...

People leave fast when your site feels confusing.

Make every page focused:
- One purpose per page  
- Clear headline  
- Call-to-action above the fold  

Ask yourself: “If I landed here for the first time, would I know what to do next?”

Tomorrow we’ll build authority that keeps people coming back.
