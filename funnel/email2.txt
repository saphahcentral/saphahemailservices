Shalom again!

Before we build anything, we must face a truth: most websites never achieve their purpose.

Why? Because they start without a funnel — no sequence, no structure, no call to action.

The Tornado Funnel fixes that by guiding visitors through stages: curiosity, connection, commitment.

Tomorrow we’ll map your own purpose so your site has a mission, not just pages.
